# Extending QuakeStudies for a Learning Legacy

Presented at NDF 2015 by Jonathan Hunt (Catalyst IT) and Christopher Thomson (University of Canterbury), 13 October 2015.

This talk is about efforts to document the lessons learned through the work of the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT). SCIRT is a construction consortium formed to rebuild Christchurch's earthquake-damaged roads and underground infrastructure. It will describe a unique cross-sector collaboration between engineers, recovery managers, digital archivists and software developers to extract and share lessons learned from the rebuild.

The project builds on the QuakeStudies digital archive, a repository powered by Fedora Commons, but presents content via a new frontend application built with Drupal. The talk will describe how the Learning Legacy material was mapped to the existing ontology in the QuakeStudies repository, and how the front-end was architected to retrieve data via the QuakeStudies API, then present the material according to needs identified by user research.
